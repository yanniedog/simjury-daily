 * Design-quality gate for cases. The schema guarantees a case is well-*formed*;
 * this guarantees it is well-*designed* as a puzzle:
 *
 *  - it contains a trap (a beat that feels more persuasive than it is worth),
 *  - it contains a real signal (a decisive beat that carries genuine weight),
 *  - it argues both guilt and innocence, and
 *  - it is actually solvable — the decisive evidence, on balance, points to the
 *    true verdict rather than away from it.
 *
 * Run over the whole queue it also enforces uniqueness and verdict variety, so
 * the daily never repeats an id/date/title or becomes predictable.
